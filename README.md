# CS250-Module-8

In this project I learned all the various parts of running and participating in a sprint. Each individual part was broken down and looked at. For interpreting user needs
we mainly used user stories that were given to us by focus groups. By using these experiences, I was able to take their wishes and implement them into the product
without leaving behind what we were trying to create. Paying attention to their requests of making the method to navigate about easy to parse, we were able to make a
product that was both easy to use and and filled the requirements.

My approach to developing programs is to ensure that the team works together as seamlessly as possible. The workplace should have as little interpersonal conflict in it as
possible, so I feel the agile process that I would incorporate the most would be communication. Resolving issues and helping one another work through issues is integral
to making a well functioning team that supports one another. It's one of the main things that I think makes a good team member. A good team member in software development
is easy to work with, diligent, takes feedback well, and communicates openly with his team.
